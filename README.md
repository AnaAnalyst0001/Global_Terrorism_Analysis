Analyzed 47 years (1970â€“2017) of data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to identify key trends in terrorist activities. The project included examining global hotspots, analyzing temporal shifts in incidents, and conducting an in-depth assessment of the top five countries by attack frequency. Additionally, explored common targets, tactics, and the demographic aspects of perpetrators and victims, while assessing the human and societal impact through casualty and damage analysis. Findings were summarized with visually compelling interpretations.
